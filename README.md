Scripting and Automation challenges


What is this repo all about?

This repo was created to show indepth about the scripting and automation challenges ive worked on during my time in 201.

Why are you learning these skills?

I'm learning these skills because scripting is essential in the world of tech, as it goes hand in hand with cybersecurity. Learning automation will not only cause future work to become more efficient,learning it will help reduce human error while writing code.

What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201?

I learned about basic IT remote service and support. Also learned about connectivity concepts including RDP and SSH, Automating tasks in Linux using Bash/Powershell scripting and learned about how to Deploy, configure, and troubleshoot a Windows 10 OS.

What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?

My favorite was class 02/My First Bash Script. It's my favorite because it's the first one I've ever done. In the past I've heard about writing code but never understood it, let alone ever thought I would create one. At first glance it was extremely intimidating, but now after doing a few I would say I'm more comfortable with them.

How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?

They can be applied when certaint apps need to get downloaded within a OS. Another reason can be for automation for scripts within a companys system. An exaple of this would be in the ops challange 10/System Process Commands, Where in Powershell the created scrip was made to print active process and then to kill a process by its Process Identification Number and close all window thru automation.

What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?
 I would continue to work on ops challange 06 and 10. In ops challange 10, i love the idea of automation that will can make life easier for the user. 

What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?

I can honestly say the memorization  of the basics within Bash, Powershell, and soon to be Python. Having cheat sheets is extremely helpful while creating scripts, but having an understanding of the fundamentals of scripting can save a lot of time while creating. This i will continue to work on.
